# Counter with useReducer

Question (easy)

Counter with useReducer
In the project you will be implementing a counter app using useReducer hook.

Implement the plain reducer in src/reducers/counterReducer.js, it simple holds a counter variable and
has two actions, one for incrementing another for decrementing by one. Initially it should be 0.

The app should render the counter value inside a span tag with id "counter". It should only display counter value inside the tag, no extra spaces.

Make two buttons with id "increment-btn" and "decrement-btn", which on clicking increase and decrease the counter respectively.
